## Creating a new game project

Before you begin working on your game, you should set up storage for the game assets and code. The easiest way is to create a project on the Defold Dashboard. Doing so creates a Git repository on our cloud servers where your work is stored.

1. Go to the [Defold Dashboard](//www.defold.com/dashboard/).
2. Click New Project.
3. Choose a name for the project and select *Start from a blank slate*.
4. Click *Save* and you're done.
